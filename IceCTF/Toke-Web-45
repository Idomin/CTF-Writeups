Hint: I have a feeling they were pretty high when they made this website... 

Starting with registring an account with random credentials. While intercepting the get request to /dashboard we see a jwt token
The jwt token has the format xxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx where the parts between the dots are base64encoded.
64decode the middle part of the token and it returns the flag.

{"flag":"IceCTF{jW7_t0K3ns_4Re_nO_p14CE_fOR_53CrE7S}","user":"aa"}
