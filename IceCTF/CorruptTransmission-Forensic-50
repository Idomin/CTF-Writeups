Open the file with " xxd -l8 filename " 
Knowing that the magic numbers for a PNG file are 0x89 0x50 0x4E 0x47 0xD 0xA 0x1A 0xA

The numbers from the file didnt match a PNG so i patched them using an hexeditor.
The site https://hexed.it can be used. Patch the bytes and save the file.
Open the file as a valid PNG and you get the flag.
